        <h3>Warm and soft Irish tradition passed down our family line, and directly into our bellies.</h3>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the milk and vinegar together, and allow to stand until curdled, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to <em>400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</em>. Grease a baking sheet. In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir the soured milk into the flour mixture until the dough just comes together, and turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead a few times, and shape into a round. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. With a sharp knife, cut an X shape into the top of the dough to release steam and help the bread keep its round shape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
